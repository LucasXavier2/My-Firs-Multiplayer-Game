**The game:** you are a square in a grid and you collect the green blocks by passing over them.

The backend was developed using **Nodejs**, **express** and **Socket.io**.  
**Socket.io** was used for the realtime gameplay, where multiple players can connect to the same game and the changes made by one client is reflected to all of the other clients

**How to run the game:**
- You must have Nodejs installed
- Download the files
- Run **npm install** command in your terminal to install everything that is needed for the project
- Run **npm start** to start the server
- You can now access the game by typing localhost:3000 in your browser
